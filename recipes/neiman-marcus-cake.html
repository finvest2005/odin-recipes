      <li>4 large eggs, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch
        baking pan.

        Bake the cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the

        Let cake cool completely before you cut it to achieve those delicious
